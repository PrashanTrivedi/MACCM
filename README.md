# MACCM
Contains the codes for our AISTATS 2023 paper titled `Multi-Agent Congestion Cost Minimization with Linear Function Approximations'

The code works as follows:

1) Open the .py file in any python editor. 
2) Change the number of agents n to 2 or 3 or 4, etc. 
3) After completion of the current run, it will generate a data file that contains an array of size number of episides
4) Do multiple runs of the code, and take the average of the regrets you get at each run.
5) Finally, use a plotting function such as matplotlib to create the  graph for other agents.
